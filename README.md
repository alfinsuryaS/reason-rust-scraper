# Reason Rust Scraper
This is a code repository for implementing scraping and crawling websites using Rust, and ReasonML. This project was originally made by me with the aim of tools in my company to work. However, because of the sudden change of ideas and concepts finally i make it like this hehe, as well as my first learning project when use ReasonML.

If you have never heard of scraping, try to read this [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) for more information.
